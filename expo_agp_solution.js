The solution focuses on ensuring compatibility between the AGP version used and the one expected by Expo.  There isn't a single magic AGP version, but rather finding the one suitable for your Expo SDK version.  Please consult the official Expo documentation for your specific SDK version to determine the correct AGP version. To fix, modify the `gradle-wrapper.properties` file in the android folder, changing the distributionUrl to point to the correct Gradle version.  Also, ensure that all your Gradle files are up-to-date. If these steps don't solve the problem, refer to Expo's documentation for more advanced troubleshooting steps for your specific issue and Expo SDK.
