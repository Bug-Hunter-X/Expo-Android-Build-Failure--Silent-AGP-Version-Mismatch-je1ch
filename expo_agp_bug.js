This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves a mismatch between the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) version specified in your project's `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` file and the version required by Expo.  The error message may not explicitly mention AGP but will point to a Gradle build failure within the Android build process. For example, you might encounter dependency resolution errors or a failure to locate specific Android libraries.
